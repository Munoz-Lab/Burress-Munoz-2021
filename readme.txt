The accompanying csv file includes the data used in the study, including
three discrete characters (ecosystem type, speciation mode, and island) and
six continuous characters: snout-vent length (svl), femur length (fml),
head length (dhl), toe length (tol), tail length (tal), and number of
lamellae (lam). All continuous characters are ln-transformed.

The first column of the file contains species names.
